### üç• - Projects
- **SOSPatinhas (SOSPaws)** - Integrated Project of the Senac Hub Academy Course
  - The project involves creating a website (we chose a fictional animal NGO), where we will work with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, databases, PHP, and more.
  - In the beginning, I served as the team leader and was responsible for much of the design work. I also took on the roles of Scrum Master and will likely do so again (and possibly as PEO), as we rotate Scrum and PEO roles every 30 days. However, I will be focusing on the backend and database management of the project.

### üç• - Learn a little about me
Hello! My name is Agatha Marie (In Portuguese, it sounds like "The Cat Marie"). I am 18 years old and currently pursuing two technical courses. I have a strong passion for back-end development and data science, areas in which I intend to specialize professionally. Additionally, I have skills in design and UX, which complement my technical profile, but my main focus is to become a back-end and data developer.

Since childhood, I have had a passion for technology and programming. I used Scratch and PowerPoint to create games, watched numerous videos about assembling and disassembling computers, watched reviews of hardware components, and tried basic programming with C language. I also enjoy organizing, creating tables, routines, and systems, which greatly supports my programming work. I am accustomed to analyzing, comparing, and organizing data. Still in the tech world, I love games and the idea of creating my own worlds and stories, and my creativity helps me find quick solutions to challenges. Outside of technology, I am passionate about music, art, and writing, which are personal aspects of my personality that I also hope to develop further.

Overall, I am a dedicated, attentive, creative, and communicative person. I believe that every experience, regardless of the circumstances or location, is an opportunity for learning. With that mindset, I strive to make my life more colorful.
